  <h1>Plastic Art Competition</h1>
  <p class="smalltext2"><b>Why you should be a part of our Movement</b><br>Many industrialized countries tow large barges, filled to capacity with garbage, approximately 6 to 10 miles off shore and then dump their cargo. Some countries, such as the United States, have set further limits, requiring municipalities to dump their garbage over 100 miles out to sea. On one hand, it may help prevent garbage from washing up on shore, but still, it doesn’t solve the problem of using our oceans as a human waste dump. <br> Scuba divers working together around the world could theoretically make much more than a dent when it comes to the global ocean pollution problem. According to PADI, there are more than 22 million certified divers in the world, in over 120 countries. Add in the world’s NAUI- certified divers and that’s a lot of potential.<br> We want to raise public awareness to the problem and to get more enthusiasts like ourselves to join this effort.
    <br> <b>Details</b> <br> The competition will take one week of time. The week-ticket will be 50€ at one of the diving sites listed in the diving map of our partners at project aware. The Trips will be held in July and August. More detailed information about time and date will follow soon, so become a member to be the first to know!
